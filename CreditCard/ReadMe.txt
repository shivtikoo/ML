I was asked to work on this case study as a part of my INTERVIEW round, for the company RedCarpetUp.

RedCarpetUp is a startup which lends to customers in India to finance their online purchases - ecommerce, travel, etc. Now the case study description: 
-Analyzing an affiliated credit card (special card only available to members of a specific group). 

Simplification of the problem statement:
The credit card company is like Citibank and the affiliated group is a company like Indian Oil or Barista. The affiliated group has to pay some fees to credit card company (because the credit card company is providing this service to the group)
