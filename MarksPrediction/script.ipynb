    "    - How it works:\n",
    "        It squares the differences between predicted and actual values, giving higher weights to larger errors.\n",
    "        Squaring removes the negative signs and penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones.\n",
    "    - Interpretation:\n",
    "        Larger MSE values indicate larger errors between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "        Lower MSE indicates better accuracy and closeness of predictions to actual values.\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error (MAE):    BALANCED VIEW OF ERRORS !!!\n",
    "    - Definition: MAE calculates the average absolute differences between the predicted values and the true values.\n",
    "    - How it works:\n",
    "        It computes the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "        It doesn't penalize large errors as heavily as MSE since it doesn't square the errors.\n",
    "    - Interpretation:\n",
    "        MAE gives a more balanced view of errors compared to MSE.\n",

    "    - How it works:\n",
    "        It compares the variance of the predictions to the variance of the actual values.\n",
    "        R-squared ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that the model perfectly predicts the target variable.\n",
    "    - Interpretation:\n",
    "        Higher R-squared values indicate a better fit of the model to the data.\n",
    "        However, it doesn't indicate the correctness of the model or if it overfits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In summary, MSE and MAE quantify the average error between predicted and actual values, while R-squared evaluates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. Each metric provides different perspectives on the model's performance, and a combination of these metrics can offer a comprehensive understanding of its strengths and weaknesses."
